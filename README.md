# Interfaces

This project includes three interfaces: Genetic Transcription, Palindrome, and Substring. Each of them represents an interactive element on the webpage that performs a specific function.

## Genetic Transcription

This interface takes a DNA sequence consisting only of the characters A, C, G, T, and returns its transcription into RNA.

## Palindrome

This interface takes a string and checks whether it is a palindrome.

## Substring

This interface takes a string and extracts a substring from it.

## Usage

To use these interfaces, simply enter the necessary data into the corresponding input fields and press the button to execute the function.
